## Startup
Purpose of undertaking this challenge is to get hired as a backend developer.

Goals for the year:
- try my best to master GoLang and Python
- finish Boot.dev courses
- practice code on Leetcode
- deploy production code / projects
When I have time or want to take a break from the above tasks, I would work on Hobby 1 & 2.

## Resources
### Main Objective - finish courses

## Notes and thoughts
Kids are graduating from the kindergarten where I work as a teacher. Although graduation happens every year, this year, however, is a little different.

I had made my mind to become a software engineer and to seek career on the tech world. 

Every day after work, I sit before my computer to code and to learn. I have read a lot of documentary, wrote a bunch of code, deployed a few projects, and yet I feel a bit hollow. By taking this challenge, I expect to see this hollowness filled.
