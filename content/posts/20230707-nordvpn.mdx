## set up NordVPN
### Install
[NordVPN on how to install on Linux](https://support.nordvpn.com/Connectivity/Linux/1325531132/Installing-and-using-NordVPN-on-Debian-Ubuntu-Raspberry-Pi-Elementary-OS-and-Linux-Mint.htm)

```bash
$ sh <(curl -sSf https://downloads.nordcdn.com/apps/linux/install.sh)
```
then follow on-screen instructions, may have to reboot

### Login
`$ nordvpn login`\
this will return a link, open in local computer's browser,\
once loggin, copy the url of **Continue**,\
then on VPS: `$ nordvpn login --callback "url"`

### Before connecting with NordVPN
Do the following before activating NordVPN on VPS machine such as linode or you will lose connection via ssh.

if ssh connection lost, you have to connect via LISH console in linode's Cloud Manager, to login, provide a user and password that's on that VPS system.
1. `$ nordvpn whitelist add port 22`   
  if hosting website, add port 80, 443 as well

2. set up ip route, example ip 11.22.33.44, [reference](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/7381/openvpn-client-connected-to-a-server-while-listening-to-ssh)\
`$ sudo ip rule add from 11.22.33.44 table 128`\
`$ sudo ip route add table 128 to 11.22.33.0/24 dev eth0`\
`$ sudo ip route add table 128 default via 11.22.33.1`

other useful commands:\
`$ route -n`\
`$ ip route show` \
`$ ip rule show`

to update values, use 'change' instead of add

3. connect NordVPN `$ nordvpn c`
4. show current IP `$ curl ifconfig.me` or `$ nordvpn status`

### use nordvpn whitelist instead
(optional) to disallow traffic from all other ports, set up iptables as follows
```bash
$ iptables -A INPUT -d 11.22.33.44 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
$ iptables -A INPUT -d 11.22.33.44 -j DROP
```

### What this does?
- The connecting IP address from your Linode VPS can be checked by `$ curl ifconfig.me`.
- HTTP connection through port 80, 443 to Linode VPS is whitelisted by NordVpn.
- SSH connection through port 22 to Linode VPS is whitelisted by NordVPN.
